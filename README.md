# Tiger Field Brief 🐅

A lightweight internal tool that collects raw GTM signal for TigerData's
time-series business and turns it into a **daily field intelligence brief** —
customer pain, sales objections, competitor mentions, docs gaps, product
confusion, and recommended PMM actions.

Paste raw notes, optionally add metadata, click **Generate Brief**, and the app
sends the notes to an LLM, extracts structured GTM signals, generates a brief,
and saves everything to Postgres so you can browse and search later.

## Stack

- **TanStack Start** (React + TypeScript) — file-based routing + server functions
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — styling
- **Postgres** + **Prisma** — database & ORM
- **Zod** — strict validation of LLM output before anything is saved
- **Anthropic (Claude)** by default, or **OpenAI** — LLM provider (configurable)

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Postgres

Any Postgres 14+ works. The quickest local option is Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name tfb-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=tiger_field_brief \
  -p 5432:5432 postgres:16
```

### 3. Configure environment

Copy the example file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> **Note:** this is a Vite/TanStack app, so it uses `.env` (the Vite/Prisma
> convention) rather than Next.js's `.env.local`. Both `.env` and `*.local`
> files are git-ignored.

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/tiger_field_brief?schema=public"

# "anthropic" (default) or "openai"
LLM_PROVIDER="anthropic"

# Anthropic (Claude)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
# ANTHROPIC_MODEL="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest"

# OpenAI (only needed if LLM_PROVIDER=openai)
# OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
# OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
```

The API key is only ever read in server functions (`src/server/*`) and is never
exposed to the client.

### 4. Run migrations

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 5. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

## How it works

1. `/new` posts the raw notes + metadata to the `generateBrief` server function.
2. `generateFieldBrief(rawNote, metadata)` (`src/server/llm.ts`) calls the LLM
   with a fixed TigerData GTM prompt.
3. The response is parsed and validated with **Zod** (`src/server/schema.ts`).
   If the LLM returns invalid JSON or the wrong shape, a clear error is shown
   and **nothing is saved**.
4. On success the raw note, brief, and signals are written to Postgres in a
   single transaction, and you're redirected to the brief.

## External sources

Beyond manual paste, the app can pull **read-only** GTM signal from external
sources and feed it into the same brief pipeline. Every integration is optional
and environment-variable driven; if a source is not configured it shows as
**Not configured** on `/sources` and is skipped (the app never breaks).

> **Read-only safety.** No connector ever writes to a remote system. X is
> search/read only — never post, like, reply, repost, follow, or DM. Slack is
> search/read only — never send/update messages, create canvases, or modify
> users/channels. Credentials are read only in server code (`src/server/*`,
> `src/lib/sources/*`) and are never exposed to the client.

### 1. Web search

Set an API key and (optionally) pick a provider. **Tavily is the default.**
If `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` is set and `WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER` is unset, the app uses
Perplexity automatically.

```dotenv
WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER="tavily"   # tavily (default) | brave | serper | perplexity
WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY="..."
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="..."       # optional; preferred for WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER=perplexity
WEB_SEARCH_BASE_URL=""         # optional: override host (proxy / self-hosted / testing)
```

Returns page title, URL, snippet/extracted text, published date (when
available), and a captured timestamp. To add a provider, implement a function in
`src/lib/sources/web.ts` and register it in `PROVIDERS`.

### 2. X (Twitter) via MCP

X search runs through an MCP server. The hosted X server supports a simple
read-only app-only Bearer route, which is the recommended v0 setup here:

```dotenv
X_MCP_SERVER_URL="https://api.x.com/mcp"
X_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN="..."          # app-only Bearer token; keep server-side only
X_MCP_SEARCH_TOOL=""            # optional: explicit search tool name
X_MCP_PROTOCOL_VERSION="2025-06-18"
```

The connector auto-detects a search tool (`search_posts_all`, `search_posts`,
`search_tweets`, `search`, …). If your server names it differently, set
`X_MCP_SEARCH_TOOL`. The MCP client (`src/lib/sources/mcp.ts`) is a thin
JSON-RPC-over-HTTP wrapper that performs the Streamable HTTP initialize
handshake and carries the `Mcp-Session-Id` header between requests.

### 3. Slack (MCP or Web API)

Two modes, MCP preferred:

```dotenv
# Mode A — Slack MCP (preferred)
SLACK_MCP_SERVER_URL="https://your-slack-mcp-server/mcp"
SLACK_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN="..."
SLACK_MCP_SEARCH_TOOL=""        # optional: explicit search tool name

# Mode B — Slack Web API (search.messages)
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxp-..."
```

> `search.messages` requires a **user** token (`xoxp-…`) with the `search:read`
> scope. A bot token (`xoxb-…`) cannot call search — use MCP mode in that case.

Slack is **read-only**: search messages, and read text, channel, author,
timestamp, and permalink when available.

### Running a source search

1. Open `/sources` to confirm which integrations are configured.
2. Go to `/sources/search`, pick a source (or **All configured**), type a query
   (or click a **default search** chip), optionally set since/until/limit, and
   click **Search Sources**. The run + results are saved.
3. Tick the results you want and click **Generate Brief From Selected
   Results**. Selected results are combined into one raw note (with source
   metadata preserved), run through `generateFieldBrief()`, saved as a normal
   `RawNote` + `Signal`s + `Brief`, linked back to the source results, and you
   are redirected to the brief.
4. Review past searches at `/sources/runs`.

### Source quality

External results are **raw market signals, not verified facts**. The prompt asks
the model to distinguish customer/prospect, internal, public-market, competitor,
and weak/noisy evidence, and not to overstate weak signal. Each extracted signal
carries `sourceQuality` (`high|medium|low`) and `signalType`
(`customer|prospect|internal|public_market|competitor|unknown`).

### Sensitive data

- **Slack results may contain confidential internal information.** Be deliberate
  about what you convert into a brief.
- Result text is truncated per result (`MAX_RESULT_TEXT_CHARS`) and the combined
  raw note is capped (`MAX_COMBINED_BRIEF_CHARS`) so no more than necessary is
  sent to the LLM. Original metadata is preserved in the database.
- Tokens, API keys, auth headers, and full source payloads are never logged.
